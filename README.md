## Non-Negotiable Participation Rule

❗ Solo repositories will not be reviewed or evaluated.

Only team-based repositories with a minimum of **2 contributors** are eligible for visibility, reviews, or any form of selection.

This ecosystem is designed for collaboration, leadership development, and real-world teamwork.

Repositories created or maintained by a single individual will be ignored without exception.
