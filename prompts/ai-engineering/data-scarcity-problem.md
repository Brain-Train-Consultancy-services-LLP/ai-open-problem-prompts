# Data Scarcity Problem

## Problem Context
Many real-world problems do not have clean or large datasets.

## Core Question
How can AI learn effectively from noisy, incomplete, or small datasets?

## Why This Matters
Most important problems lack perfect data.

## Exploration Directions
- Learning from limited data
- Synthetic or simulated data
- Human feedback integration
- Robust model design

## Collaboration Notes
Ideas from research and industry are welcome.
