# Explainability Gap

## Problem Context
AI systems often give correct outputs, but people do not understand how decisions are made.

## Core Question
How can AI explain its decisions to non-technical users?

## Why This Matters
People do not trust systems they cannot understand.

## Exploration Directions
- Simple explanations for complex models
- Visual or story-based explanations
- Confidence and uncertainty signals
- Human-friendly AI interfaces

## Collaboration Notes
Open for ideas, examples, and design approaches.
