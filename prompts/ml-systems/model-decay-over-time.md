# Model Decay Over Time

## Problem Context
Models perform well initially but degrade later.

## Core Question
Why do AI models lose accuracy over time?

## Why This Matters
Outdated models cause silent failures.

## Exploration Directions
- Changing user behavior
- Data drift
- Monitoring gaps
- Retraining challenges

## Collaboration Notes
Long-term system thinking is needed.
