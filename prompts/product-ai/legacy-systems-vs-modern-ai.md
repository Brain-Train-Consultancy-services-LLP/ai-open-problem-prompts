# Legacy Systems vs Modern AI

## Problem Context
Most industries run on outdated software systems.
Replacing them is risky and expensive.

## Core Question
How can AI coexist with or augment legacy systems instead of replacing them?

## Why This Matters
Real-world systems cannot be rebuilt from scratch.

## Exploration Directions
- Wrappers and adapters
- Incremental intelligence layers
- Risk-aware deployment
- Cost-benefit trade-offs

## Collaboration Notes
Discuss integration strategies and constraints.
