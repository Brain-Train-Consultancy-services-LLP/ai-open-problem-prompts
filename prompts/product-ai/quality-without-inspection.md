# Quality Without Inspection

## Problem Context
Manual inspection is slow, expensive, and inconsistent.

## Core Question
Can AI predict defects before they happen?

## Why This Matters
Preventing defects is cheaper than fixing them later.

## Exploration Directions
- Predictive quality models
- Process-level signals
- Early warning systems
- Human verification loops

## Collaboration Notes
Open for manufacturing and service examples.
